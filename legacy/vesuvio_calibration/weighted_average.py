    NAME:
      wmom()
      
    PURPOSE:
      Calculate the weighted mean, error, and optionally standard deviation of
      an input array.  By default error is calculated assuming the weights are
      1/err^2, but if you send calcerr=True this assumption is dropped and the
      error is determined from the weighted scatter.

    CALLING SEQUENCE:
     wmean,werr = wmom(arr, weights, inputmean=None, calcerr=False, sdev=False)
    
    INPUTS:
      arr: A numpy array or a sequence that can be converted.
      weights: A set of weights for each elements in array.
    OPTIONAL INPUTS:
      inputmean: 
          An input mean value, around which them mean is calculated.
      calcerr=False: 
          Calculate the weighted error.  By default the error is calculated as
          1/sqrt( weights.sum() ).  If calcerr=True it is calculated as sqrt(
          (w**2 * (arr-mean)**2).sum() )/weights.sum()
      sdev=False: 
          If True, also return the weighted standard deviation as a third
          element in the tuple.

    OUTPUTS:
      wmean, werr: A tuple of the weighted mean and error. If sdev=True the
         tuple will also contain sdev: wmean,werr,wsdev
